<p> Hi! My name is **Dianna**.
I'm currently a student at the University of Calgary pursuing a Kinesiology degree. 
My current plans for the future is to become a Registered Massage Therapist as well as pursue a career in the Ergonomics industry.
</p>

<p> Outside of school, I enjoy running, cycling, playing badminton, and walking my two dogs, Kipper and Iggy. Kipper is an 8 year old dachshund/chihuahua mix and Iggy is a 10 month old corgi. They're named after Flames legends Miikka Kiprusoff and Jarome Iginla. </p>

<p> My family and I are avid Flames fans and you can often find my brother and I at their games! We often watch their affiliate team, the Calgary Wranglers as well. </p>
