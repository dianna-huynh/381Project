<p> Hi! My name is Dianna.
I'm currently a student at the University of Calgary pursuing a Kinesiology degree. 
My current plans for the future is to become a Registered Massage Therapist as well as pursuing Ergonomics.
</p)

<p> Outside of school, I enjoy running, cycling, playing badminton, and walking my two dogs, Kipper and Iggy. Kipper is an 8 year old dachschund/chihuahua mix and Iggy is a 10 month old corgi. They're named after Flames legends Mika Kiprusoff and Jarome Iginla. </p>

<p> My family and I are avid Flames fans and you can often find my brother and I at their games. </p>
