<h3>Video Analysis Breakdown</h3>
  
<p> This video contains three snapshots of key moments in a badminton smash return: the set-up, the return itself, and the follow through. I used various tools to complete this analysis in Dartfish including joint angles for the knees, drawing of lines and circles to highlight key body positions such as the feet and the stance, and the use of text to explain why or why not the movement is ideal. </p>
