[Click Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dianna-huynh/381Project/master/assets/images/Dianna-Running-Workouts.xlsx) and you will find an Excel sheet demonstrating the skills that I have learned in class.
<p>This Excel sheet consists of data from my past running workouts dating from September 2022 to April 2023.</p>

<p>The running data includes data such as the date the exercise was performed, the duration, distance, average speed, total and active energy expenditure, maximum heart rate, step count, and step cadence.</p>

<p>The means and standard deviations of certain measurements can also be found as well as a conversion for the means and standard deviations of energy expenditure into kcal.</p>

<p>Equations are used to calculate body density and body fat percentage. I also calculated pace (mins/km) on my own.</p>

<p>In this data sheet, you are able to change certain subject characteristics such as age, height, and weight as well as the individual trials of the skinfold measurements. All other cells in this data sheet are locked, including equations.</p>

<p>If necessary, the password for the sheet is KNES381.</p>


<h3> Summary </h3>
<h4> Histograms </h4>
<p> The following are frequency histograms for total and active energy expenditure. </p>

<h4> Scatter Graphs with Line of Best Fit </h4>
<p> The following are scatter graphs comparing various measurements with corresponding correlation coefficients and Paired T-Test values </p>
