# Welcome
This is my website created to demonstrate my skills learned in KNES 381.  
The theme that I used is the jekyll theme “Minimal Mistakes”.

# Adding New Posts
Addition of a new post can be done by adding a file to “ _posts”. The file name should be listed as the following: “YEAR-MONTH-DAY-Title.md”.   
For more information, [click here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/posts/).

# Adding New Images
The addition of new images, videos, or files (such as excel) should be added to “assets/images”.
For more information, [click here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/post%20formats/post-image-standard/).

# Adding Gallery Images
For the addition of images in a gallery, I followed [this](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/post%20formats/post-gallery/) tutorial.

# Support
