<p>This is a website that I created on GitHub using HTML and Markdown language. I used the Jekyll theme (written in Ruby programming) “Minimal Mistakes” created by Michael Rose.</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to help me display various tools and programs that I have learned to use over the course of this semester.</p>

<p>In the course we went over:
- Command Line Usage
- Use of SSH keys
- Version Control
- GitHub Repositories
- Markdown Language
- HTML Language
- Scratch MIT
-  Python
-  Excel
- Video Analysis with DartFish Pro
- Various Kinesiology Tools (Eg. My Jump, VR)
- Fit Files Analysis (eg. Using Golden Cheetah)
</p>

<p>This website covers demonstrations of:
- Excel
- DartFish Pro
- Effective use of Markdown and HTML language
</p>
