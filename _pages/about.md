<p>This is a website that I created on GitHub using HTML and Markdown language. I used the Jekyll theme (written in Ruby programming) “Minimal Mistakes” created by Michael Rose.</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to help me display various tools and programs that I have learned to use over the course of this semester.</p>

<p>In the course we went over:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Command Line Usage</li>
  <li>Use of SSH keys</li>
  <li>Version Control</li>
  <li>GitHub Repositories</li>
  <li>Markdown Language</li>
  <li>HTML Language</li>
  <li>[Scratch MIT](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/801553989/)</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Excel</li>
  <li>Video Analysis with DartFish Pro</li>
  <li>Various Kinesiology Tools (Eg. My Jump, VR)</li>
  <li>Fit Files Analysis (eg. Using Golden Cheetah)</li>
</ul>
  
[Here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/801553989/) is the link to my Scratch maze.

<p>This website covers demonstrations of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Excel</li>
